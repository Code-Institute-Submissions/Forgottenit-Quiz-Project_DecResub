# Design Choices
## Fonts
font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;
font-style: oblique;

I found these fonts to be neat and legible on different screens and are widely available
## Colours
background: linear-gradient(75deg, rgba(250, 26, 48, 0.1), rgba(32, 159, 58, 0.1));

The colour chosen was a gradient of Red and Green, with Greens and Reds picked for correct and incorrect answers as these would be standards expecting from the user. The background for answers is cream with black text to display text as it stands out.



# Features
## Existing Features
### Landing page
The landing page displays the rules of the game and the game options, that the questions are multiple choice and that the user must ente a name (using letters) etc. There is then input for the user to enter a username and hit play
### Category Section
This displays 15 categories from which the user can pick up to 5, to selecy up to a maximium of 50 questions

### Quiz Section
This area contains the quiz, it displays the question number with a progress bar, the users current score and a 15second timer at the yop, followed underneath by the current question, with 4 possible answers, answers are displayed once selected as Green if the user is correct and Red if they are not. There is a reveal answer down the bottom and a quit button. If the timer runs out or the user chooses to reveal the correct answer the font changes color to green to signify correct and red for incorrect. The input buttons also display shadowing once selected.
